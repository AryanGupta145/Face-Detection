# Face-Detection
Face Detection and Counting System
This project implements a face detection and counting system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The system processes images and videos to identify faces, draw bounding boxes around them, display detection confidence scores, and count the total number of faces detected.

Key Features:
Real-Time Face Detection: Utilizes MediaPipe for efficient face detection in both images and video streams.
Bounding Box Visualization: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces for easy identification.
Confidence Score Display: Shows the confidence score for each detected face, providing insight into detection accuracy.
Face Counting: Accurately counts the total number of faces detected in each image or video frame.
This project is ideal for applications requiring accurate face detection and counting, such as security systems, crowd analysis, and user engagement tracking.

How to Use:
Image Processing: Upload an image, and the system will detect and count faces, displaying the results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
Video Processing: Upload a video file, and the system will process each frame in real-time, providing continuous face detection and counting.
Technologies Used:
OpenCV: For image and video processing.
MediaPipe: For face detection.
Installation:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the script to start processing images or videos.
Feel free to customize this further to fit the specifics of your project!
